# A. EVALUATING EXISTING RESEARCH

## Easy

- [ ] Check whether studies are published in predatory journals

- [ ] Check whether studies reference pre-registrations

- [ ] Note whether the study is experimental or observational

- [ ] Verify that studies report effect sizes alongside or instead of just P-values

- [ ] Check whether studies discuss their limitations

- [ ] Check whether studies discuss alternative interpretations of findings

## Moderate

- [ ] Assess whether studies emphasize statistical vs. biological significance

- [ ] Evaluate whether studies reference contrary findings, not just supportive works

- [ ] Distinguish whether research is exploratory (hypothesis-generating) or confirmatory (hypothesis-testing)

- [ ] Assess whether the study has adequate statistical power

- [ ] Check for signs of HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known)

## Difficult

- [ ] Evaluate reproducibility of reported analyses

- [ ] Assess whether causal inferences from observational research are sufficiently justified

- [ ] Conduct a systematic review following standardized protocols

# B. PLANNING YOUR RESEARCH

## Easy

- [ ] Complete ethics approvals prior to data collection

- [ ] Specify whether study is experimental or observational

- [ ] Acquire ORCID for all contributors

- [ ] Create infographics to visualize study design

- [ ] Plan for appropriate licenses for all outputs

## Moderate

- [ ] Establish research partnerships considering ethical, cultural, and practical dimensions

- [ ] Track all contributors and contributions throughout project

- [ ] Create a data management plan (DMP)

- [ ] Clearly define research questions (exploratory) or hypotheses (confirmatory)

- [ ] Define target population and scope of inference

- [ ] Define dependent and independent variables for each analysis

- [ ] Define observational or experimental units

- [ ] Plan for proper randomization and blinding when appropriate

- [ ] Specify evidence that would support or refute hypotheses (confirmatory research)

- [ ] Specify significance (alpha) level for confirmatory research

- [ ] Plan to report contributions using CRediT or MeRIT frameworks

- [ ] Plan to adjust P-values for multiple testing where appropriate

- [ ] Have research plan reviewed by subject matter experts

- [ ] Have research plan reviewed by peers

## Difficult

- [ ] Pre-register study design and analysis plan in a public repository (embargo if necessary)

- [ ] Conduct prospective power analysis using plausible effect sizes (confirmatory research)

- [ ] Plan statistical models for non-Gaussian error distributions where appropriate

- [ ] Plan statistical models for multivariate responses where appropriate

- [ ] Plan statistical models for hierarchical/non-independent sampling where appropriate

- [ ] Specify how model assumptions will be checked

- [ ] Plan a multiverse analysis for assessing robustness of findings

- [ ] Ensure observational study design meets criteria for causal inference (if applicable)

# C. CONDUCTING YOUR RESEARCH

## Easy

- [ ] Document data and procedures as per planned protocols

- [ ] Document unexpected incidents

- [ ] Document data exclusions with justification

- [ ] Document deviations from planned protocols

## Moderate

- [ ] Use transparent/open, version-controlled reporting systems

**Notes:**

\newpage

# D. REPORTING, INTERPRETING, AND COMMUNICATING YOUR RESEARCH FINDINGS

## Easy

- [ ] State sample sizes for all treatments

- [ ] State sample sizes for each analysis

- [ ] State sample sizes in each figure and table

- [ ] Label speculation clearly when present

- [ ] Report whether analyses were planned or unplanned

## Moderate

- [ ] Report model assumption checks transparently

- [ ] Ensure each analysis links to a pre-specified question/hypothesis

- [ ] Use effective data visualizations that reveal rather than conceal data

- [ ] Maximize accessibility and inclusivity of outputs

- [ ] Report effect sizes and uncertainty measures (e.g., confidence intervals) for all analyses

- [ ] Discuss real-world relevance of effect sizes

- [ ] Report P-values alongside effect sizes (when appropriate for confirmatory research)

- [ ] Report adjusted P-values for multiple testing (when appropriate)

- [ ] Interpret findings objectively

- [ ] Discuss alternative interpretations of findings

- [ ] Avoid persuasive language

- [ ] Avoid overselling findings

- [ ] Avoid over-generalizing findings beyond target population

\newpage

# E. ENHANCING TRANSPARENCY, REACH, AND IMPACT

## Easy

- [ ] Archive data and code in an appropriate repository with detailed metadata

- [ ] Publish preprint and/or Open Access

- [ ] Follow best practices for title, abstract, and keywords

- [ ] Create a broadly-accessible infographic

## Moderate

- [ ] Ensure data and code are FAIR-compliant (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

- [ ] Ensure data and code are CARE-compliant (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics)

- [ ] Ask peers to verify data and code are FAIR
