# A. PLANNING YOUR RESEARCH

## Study Rationale and Planning

- [ ] Objectively establish the state of knowledge through unbiased literature assessment

- [ ] Articulate research questions (exploratory) and/or hypotheses (confirmatory)

- [ ] Articulate how each question/hypothesis will be evaluated

- [ ] Define target population(s) for any and all inferences

- [ ] Identify others who could be impacted by the research (if applicable)

- [ ] If applicable, document any re-use/overlap of data from previous/ongoing research

- [ ] Specify whether study is experimental or observational

- [ ] If observational, plan how sampling bias will be minimized

- [ ] If experimental, plan for proper randomization and blinding (where appropriate)

- [ ] If experimental, describe and rationalize all interventions/treatments

- [ ] If confirmatory, conduct prospective power analysis using plausible effect sizes

- [ ] If confirmatory, detail what would constitute evidence consistent with each distinct hypothesis

- [ ] If confirmatory, plan P-value adjustments for multiple testing where appropriate

- [ ] If observational, describe and rationalize all dependent and independent variables

- [ ] Describe and rationalize structure of statistical model for each planned analysis

- [ ] Specify how statistical model assumptions will be checked

- [ ] Articulate ethical considerations where appropriate

- [ ] Complete ethics approvals prior to data collection

- [ ] Consider planning a multiverse analysis for assessing robustness of findings

**Notes:**

<br><br>

## Research Partnerships and Contributions

- [ ] Establish research partnerships considering ethical, cultural, and practical dimensions

- [ ] Ensure those potentially impacted by research can contribute meaningfully to design, implementation, and dissemination (where applicable)

- [ ] Plan to track all contributors and contributions throughout project using CRediT or MeRIT frameworks

- [ ] Encourage all contributors to acquire an ORCID

- [ ] Plan for appropriate licenses for all outputs

**Notes:**

<br><br>

## Pre-registration and Data Management

- [ ] Pre-register study design and analysis plan in a public repository (embargo if necessary)

- [ ] Create a data management plan (DMP)

**Notes:**

<br><br>

## Peer Review and Feedback

- [ ] Have research plan reviewed by subject matter experts

- [ ] Have research plan reviewed by peers outside your immediate field

- [ ] If appropriate, create infographic to visualize study design

**Notes:**

<br><br>

# B. CONDUCTING YOUR RESEARCH

## Documentation and Transparency

- [ ] Document data and procedures as per planned protocols and DMP

- [ ] Document deviations from planned protocols (e.g., loss of samples, measurement mistakes)

- [ ] Document data exclusions with justification

- [ ] Consider using transparent/open, version-controlled reporting systems

**Notes:**

<br><br>

# C. REPORTING, INTERPRETING, AND COMMUNICATING YOUR RESEARCH FINDINGS

## Reporting and Transparency

- [ ] Report all unanticipated incidents (e.g., loss of samples, measurement mistakes)

- [ ] Connect each analysis with a specific question or hypothesis

- [ ] Distinguish exploratory from confirmatory analyses

- [ ] Report whether analyses were planned or unplanned

- [ ] Report results of checks on model assumptions

- [ ] Report effect sizes with uncertainty measures (e.g., confidence intervals) for all analyses

- [ ] If confirmatory, report effect sizes (with confidence intervals) alongside P-values

- [ ] If confirmatory, report adjusted P-values for multiple testing (where appropriate)

- [ ] If exploratory, report effect sizes (with confidence intervals)

- [ ] Include figures that reveal rather than conceal data

- [ ] Use accessible visualizations (e.g., accessible colour palettes in figures)

- [ ] Consistently report sample sizes for all analyses, treatments, figures, and tables

**Notes:**

<br><br>

## Interpretation and Context

- [ ] Articulate scientific significance of each finding

- [ ] Where appropriate, articulate practical relevance to all stakeholders

- [ ] Discuss real-world relevance of effect sizes

- [ ] Interpret findings objectively

- [ ] Reference both supportive and contrary findings

- [ ] Discuss study limitations

- [ ] If observational, acknowledge limits to causal inference

- [ ] Discuss alternative interpretations of findings

- [ ] Avoid persuasive language

- [ ] Avoid overselling or over-generalizing findings beyond target population

- [ ] Clearly label any speculation as such

**Notes:**

<br><br>

## Additional Reporting

- [ ] Refer to ethics approvals and/or permits where necessary

- [ ] Describe each author's roles in the research using CRediT or MeRIT

- [ ] Acknowledge any conflicts of interest

- [ ] Acknowledge all funding supports

- [ ] Acknowledge any use of AI tools

- [ ] Acknowledge all (non-authors) who contributed to the research

**Notes:**

<br><br>

# D. ENHANCING TRANSPARENCY, REACH, AND IMPACT

## Data and Code Sharing

- [ ] Ensure data are as open as possible and as closed as necessary according to FAIR principles

- [ ] Ensure data are as open as possible and as closed as necessary according to CARE principles

- [ ] Archive data in an appropriate repository with detailed metadata

- [ ] Ensure executable analysis code is as open as possible and as closed as necessary

- [ ] Archive code in an appropriate repository

**Notes:**

<br><br>

## Publication and Dissemination

- [ ] Publish Open Access and/or as a preprint

- [ ] Follow best practices for title, abstract, and keywords

- [ ] Consider creating a broadly-accessible infographic for extension purposes

**Notes:**
