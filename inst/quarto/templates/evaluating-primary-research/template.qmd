## Study Rationale and Planning

- [ ] Objectively establishes the state of knowledge through unbiased literature assessment

- [ ] Articulates research questions (exploratory) and/or hypotheses (confirmatory)

- [ ] Articulates how each question/hypothesis will be evaluated

- [ ] Defines target population(s) for any and all inferences

- [ ] Identifies others who could be impacted by the research (if applicable)

- [ ] If observational, study describes how sampling bias was minimized

- [ ] If experimental, study employs proper randomization and blinding (where appropriate)

- [ ] If confirmatory, study explicitly considers statistical power

- [ ] If confirmatory, study details what would constitute evidence consistent with each distinct hypothesis

- [ ] If observational, study describes and rationalizes all dependent and independent variables

- [ ] If experimental, study describes and rationalizes all interventions/treatments

- [ ] If confirmatory, study appropriately considers P-value adjustments for multiple testing where appropriate

- [ ] Describes and rationalizes structure of statistical model for each analysis

- [ ] Describes how statistical model assumptions will be checked

- [ ] Articulates ethical considerations where appropriate

- [ ] BONUS: Study references pre-registration or registered report

## Reporting and Transparency

- [ ] Reports all unanticipated incidents (e.g., loss of samples; measurement mistakes)

- [ ] If applicable, study details any re-use/overlap of data from previous/ongoing research

- [ ] Connects each analysis with a question or hypothesis

- [ ] Distinguishes exploratory from confirmatory analyses

- [ ] Reports results of evaluations of statistical model assumptions

- [ ] Reports effect sizes with uncertainty measures (e.g., confidence intervals)

- [ ] Reveals rather than conceals data (e.g., shows individual data points in figures)

- [ ] Uses accessible visualizations (e.g., accessible colour palettes in figures)

- [ ] Reports findings of both planned and unplanned analyses

- [ ] Consistently reports sample sizes for all analyses and figures

- [ ] Provides access to raw data according to FAIR principles

- [ ] Provides reproducible analysis code and workflows

- [ ] Refers to ethics approvals and/or permits where necessary

- [ ] Describes each author's roles in the research

- [ ] Acknowledges any conflicts of interest

- [ ] Acknowledges all funding supports

- [ ] Acknowledges any use of AI tools

- [ ] Acknowledges all (non-authors) who contributed to the research

**Notes:**

## Interpretation and Context

- [ ] Articulates scientific significance of each finding

- [ ] Where appropriate, articulates practical relevance to all stakeholders

- [ ] References both supportive and contrary findings

- [ ] Discusses study limitations

- [ ] If observational, study acknowledges limits to causal inference

- [ ] Discusses alternative interpretations of findings

- [ ] Avoids overselling or over-generalizing findings

- [ ] Any speculation is clearly labelled as such

## Additional Considerations for Community-Engaged Research

- [ ] Those potentially impacted by the research played a role in designing the study

- [ ] Partners and participants were meaningfully involved

- [ ] CARE guidelines were followed

- [ ] Research extends meaningfully to those impacted

- [ ] Data ownership and sovereignty considerations are addressed

**Notes:**

## Warning Signs

- [ ] Published in a predatory journal

- [ ] Uses sensationalist or emotive language

- [ ] Uses phrase "marginally significant"

- [ ] Uses phrase "preliminary findings" without articulating if and how a preliminary study was planned

- [ ] Conceals rather than reveals the data

- [ ] Is clearly exploratory but emphasizes P-values

- [ ] Reports results of analyses that were not planned or described in methods

- [ ] Draws causal inferences from observational research with minimal justification

- [ ] References primarily supportive works while ignoring contrary findings

- [ ] Appears to disguise exploratory research as confirmatory research
